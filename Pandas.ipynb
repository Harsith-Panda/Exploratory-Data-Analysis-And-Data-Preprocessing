    "# Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "- It is a library built upon numpy, while numpy is used handle n-dimensional arrray. Pandas speciality or use case is to handle handle tabular form of data like (csv, excel and etc)\n",
    "- It can handle, manipulate many number of structured datatypes. Html, Sql, CSV, excel and more like that.\n",
    "- It can't hanle `.mp3`,`.mp4` or other audio formats directly. There are other libraries that do that and convert them back to an audio numpy array\n",
    "- Pandas gives us to main objects for us to manipulate data\n",
    "    1. Series -> 1D array (labelled data)\n",
    "    2. DataFrame -> 2d tabular structure (mainly used for manipulating tabular structure)\n",
    "- Fundamentally dataframe is a form of 2d structure with rows and columns but a row entry (cell) can have complex dt of ndimension numpy array as well. But fundamentally treated as 2d array (table)\n",
    "- `Interview definition` -> Pandas is built on NumPy and is designed for structured, tabular data. Its primary objects are Series (1D labeled arrays) and DataFrames (2D labeled tables). While it can ingest data from formats like CSV, Excel, SQL, and HTML, it does not process media formats like MP3 or MP4 directly. DataFrames are fundamentally 2D, though individual cells may contain complex Python objects.\n",
    "- One column or One row from a table / dataframe is still a series\n",
    "\n",
    "## Series\n",
    "- It is basically an object or datastructure provided to us by pandas to create 1d Structured labeled array\n",
    "- Like a column in excel with row labels\n",
    "- Having row labels is optional. By default index is used as row labels. It is represented in form of two columns first one in left being the row labels and the ones in the right are corresponding values.\n",
    "- When you are trying to have custom labels, the number of labels must be equal to the total number of elements\n",
    "- `pd.Series([1,2,3,4])` or `pd.Series([1,2,3,4], index=[a,b,c,d])`\n",
    "- Despite having custom labels you can use internal indexing basically indexes to access elements as well\n",
    "- Having custom column names is called label-based indexing, integer-location based indexing refers to the actual indexes of series\n",
    "- `iloc` -> Accepts only integer-loaction based indexing\n",
    "- `loc` -> Accepts both integer based and label based indexing\n",
    "- Series also as head function like dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataframe\n",
    "- This is an other object or DS provided to use by pandas\n",
    "- This is basically of 2d form, but internal cells can have more complex nested structure (dimension)\n",
    "- Dataframe is basically like a table with rows and columns.\n",
    "- `iloc` in a data frame includes both rows and columns [rows, columns] for more dimensions same as numpy. Right to left -> top most to inner most"
