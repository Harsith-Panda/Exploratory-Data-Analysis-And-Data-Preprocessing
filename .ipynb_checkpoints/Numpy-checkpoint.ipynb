    "## Basic Introduction:\n",
    "- Numpy stands for numerical python. It is a library written in C\n",
    "- It helps to perform mathematical calculations faster using multidemionsonal array\n",
    "- It introduces a new datatype called *numpy array/ndarray*, which is a powerful n-dimensional array.\n",
    "- It is homogenous meaning (primarily used for storing numbers). String can also be stored but rarely used `<U3` datatype\n",
    "- Fixed item size must be defined before. But append is present but works differently (it returns a new copy of ndarray does not change in-place)\n",
    "- Scalar values are of type `np.<datatype>` like `np.int64` something like that\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use numpy over standard python array?\n",
    "- Integers in python are basically ~ 28 bytes based on the architecture.\n",
    "- Python list are basically pointers to pyobjects. Python list values are scattered across heap memory. List pointers are contigous.\n",
    "- In numpy numbers as stored as raw C values. Hence, they consume less space.\n",
    "- Other reasons include vectorization, faster addition, inbuilt methods for matrix operations etc\n",
    "- In python stack only has references actual values are stored in heap"
